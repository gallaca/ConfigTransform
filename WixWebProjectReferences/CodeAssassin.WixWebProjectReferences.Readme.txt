To reference a Web project, open the WiX project (*.wixproj) file for editing
and add the following at the end of the file immediately before the closing 
</Project> tag:

  <ItemGroup>
    <WebProjectReference Include="[relative path to web project]\[web project name].csproj">
      <RefTargetDir>INSTALLLOCATION</RefTargetDir>
    </WebProjectReference>
  </ItemGroup>

The value "INSTALLLOCATION" used as the example value for the <RefTargetDir>
element can be substituted with the Id of another <Directory> element declared
in your Product.wxs file.

The <WebProjectReference> element can be repeated for each Web project output
to be harvested for inclusion in the WiX project.

Once a <WebProjectReference> item has been added to the WiX project file,
reference the harvested component groups inside a <Feature> element declared in
your Product.wxs file:

  <Feature [...] >
    <ComponentGroupRef Id="[web project name].Binaries" />
    <ComponentGroupRef Id="[web project name].Content" />
  </Feature>

An example replacement value for [web project name] in both the above snippets
would be "WebApplication1".
